  name: Scorpion
  roll: 3d
  locations:
    - id: eye
      choice_name: Eyes
      table_name: Eyes
      hit_penalty: -9
      description: An attack that misses by 1 hits the torso instead. Only impaling (imp), piercing (pi-, pi, pi+, pi++), and tight-beam burning (burn) attacks can target the eye – and only from the front or sides. Injury over HP÷10 blinds the eye. Otherwise, treat as skull, but without the extra DR!
    - id: skull
      choice_name: Skull
      table_name: Skull
      slots: 2
      hit_penalty: -7
      dr_bonus: 2
      description: 'An attack that misses by 1 hits the torso instead. Wounding modifier is x4. Knockdown rolls are at -10. Critical hits use the Critical Head Blow Table (B556). Exception: These special effects do not apply to toxic (tox) damage.'
    - id: face
      choice_name: Face
      table_name: Face
      slots: 1
      hit_penalty: -5
      description: An attack that misses by 1 hits the torso instead. Jaw, cheeks, nose, ears, etc. If the target has an open-faced helmet, ignore its DR. Knockdown rolls are at -5. Critical hits use the Critical Head Blow Table (B556). Corrosion (cor) damage gets a x1½ wounding modifier, and if it inflicts a major wound, it also blinds one eye (both eyes on damage over full HP). Random attacks from behind hit the skull instead.
    - id: neck
      choice_name: Neck
      table_name: Neck
      slots: 1
      hit_penalty: -5
      description: An attack that misses by 1 hits the torso instead. Neck and throat. Increase the wounding multiplier of crushing (cr) and corrosion (cor) attacks to x1½, and that of cutting (cut) damage to x2. At the GM’s option, anyone killed by a cutting (cut) blow to the neck is decapitated!
    - id: arm
      choice_name: Arm
      table_name: Arm
      slots: 2
      hit_penalty: -2
      description: 'Reduce the wounding multiplier of large piercing (pi+), huge piercing (pi++), and impaling (imp) damage to x1. Any major wound (loss of over ½ HP from one blow) cripples the limb. Damage beyond that threshold is lost. If holding a shield, double the penalty to hit: -4 for shield arm instead of -2.'
    - id: torso
      choice_name: Torso
      table_name: Torso
      slots: 3
    - id: tail
      choice_name: Tail
      table_name: Tail
      slots: 1
      hit_penalty: -3
      description: If a tail counts as an Extra Arm or a Striker, or is a fish tail, treat it as a limb (arm, leg) for crippling purposes; otherwise, treat it as an extremity (hand, foot). A crippled tail affects balance. For a ground creature, this gives -1 DX. For a swimmer or flyer, this gives -2 DX and halves Move. If the creature has no tail, or a very short one (like a rabbit), treat as torso.
    - id: leg
      choice_name: Leg
      table_name: Leg
      slots: 4
      hit_penalty: -2
      description: Reduce the wounding multiplier of large piercing (pi+), huge piercing (pi++), and impaling (imp) damage to x1. Any major wound (loss of over ½ HP from one blow) cripples the limb. Damage beyond that threshold is lost.
    - id: foot
      choice_name: Foot
      table_name: Foot
      slots: 2
      hit_penalty: -4
      description: Reduce the wounding multiplier of large piercing (pi+), huge piercing (pi++), and impaling (imp) damage to x1. Any major wound (loss of over ⅓ HP from one blow) cripples the extremity. Damage beyond that threshold is lost.
    - id: vitals
      choice_name: Vitals
      table_name: Vitals
      hit_penalty: -3
      description: An attack that misses by 1 hits the torso instead. Heart, lungs, kidneys, etc. Increase the wounding modifier for an impaling (imp) or any piercing (pi-, pi, pi+, pi++) attack to x3. Increase the wounding modifier for a tight-beam burning (burn) attack to x2. Other attacks cannot target the vitals.
