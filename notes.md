### Remaining work for a basic port to Go

#### Unison-specific work that needs to be done

- Printing support in unison
- Drag & drop support in the unison Table object
- Carefully comb over the interface and identify areas where things aren't working well on Windows and Linux, since I spend nearly all of my development time on macOS and may have not noticed deficiencies there

    - Check for GCS updates...
- Support for .gct (template) files
  - Adjust the editors to support the differences when attached to a template rather than a sheet
  - Applying a template to a sheet
- Printing support for sheets (requires support in unison first)
- Make final decision on whether tables that have no content in the sheet should be hidden (complicates updates and makes it harder for users to discover they exist)
