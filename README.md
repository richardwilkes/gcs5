## GURPS Character Sheet

GURPS Character Sheet (GCS) is a stand-alone, interactive, character sheet editor that allows you to build characters
for the [GURPS 4<sup>th</sup> Edition](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps) roleplaying game system.

### This is an experimental effort to rebuild [GCS](https://github.com/richardwilkes/gcs) using the Go language. It is not currently usable.

### This code has been merged into the master branch of the [GCS](https://github.com/richardwilkes/gcs) project.
